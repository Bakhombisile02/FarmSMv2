# FarmSMv2 

This prototype web application was developed by Bakhombisile Dlamini as part of the project for PROG7311 in Varsity College. The application is built using Visual Studio and C# and provides a user-friendly interface for managing farmers and their associated products. It allows users to log in with different roles, such as farmer and employee, and perform various tasks related to farmer and product management. The application utilizes a database to store farmer and product information.

## Lecturer Changes 

1. The code is no longer generic and is commented sufficently.
2. Database is on Azure Cloud and connects with a connection string
3. Application deployed to the cloud

## Functionality

The prototype web application includes the following functionality

1. Database of Farmers The website maintains a database of farmers along with their associated products. Farmers can be added to the database, and their information can be managed through the application.

2. User Roles The application provides two different user roles farmer and employee. Each role has specific privileges and access to user-specific information.

3. Login System Farmers and employees are required to log into the website to access their respective information. The login system ensures secure access to the application.

4. Add Farmer Logged-in employees can add new farmers to the database through the application. The required information, such as name, contact details, and other relevant data, can be provided while adding a farmer.

5. Add Product Logged-in farmers can add new products to their profile in the database. They can specify details like product name, description, quantity, and other relevant information.

6. View Products Supplied by Farmer Logged-in employees can view the list of all products ever supplied by a specific farmer. This functionality enables employees to monitor the products associated with each farmer.

7. Filter Products Logged-in employees can filter the displayed list of products supplied by a specific farmer based on a date range or product type. This feature allows efficient searching and sorting of products based on specific criteria.

## Sample Data

To provide a demonstration of the application's features without requiring extensive data entry, the prototype includes sample data. The sample data consists of pre-populated farmers and their associated products, showcasing the various functionalities of the application. This allows marketers and users to explore the application's capabilities during the demonstration.
